# Flask-edge-detection
This is the project for an edge detection website which contains a home page, an about page, and a convert page. 
The home page is for standard edge detection, allowing the user to submit an image to go through any of the three available types of edge detection.
The three types of edge detection, Canny, Sobel, and Contour, are all explained on the about page.
On the convert page, the website uses edge detection on live feed captured by a connected camera, with the option to edit the threshold values.
